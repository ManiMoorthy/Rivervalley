                                        <p><b>What is Rest Home?</b></p>
                                        <p>The industry includes skilled nursing facilities for recovery from acute or chronic medical conditions, mental health and substance abuse facilities, and various types of community care and assisted living arrangements.
                                            Rest homes are considered a residential care facility that incorporates both a medical and social model. A wide array of healthcare and dependent-care services are provided, ranging from expensive 24-hour nursing
                                            care in skilled nursing settings, to the more ambulatory resident of the rest home.<br>In Rest Home, the residents generally need to be ambulatory and have the ability to perform basic bathing and bathroom needs
                                            independently. Once acuity levels rise to the point that a rest home cannot provide the level of care required the state requires the resident be moved to a skilled nursing facility.<br>Nursing homes typically
                                            care for patients recovering from major medical procedures and older patients with chronic disabilities and deteriorating mental and physical capacities. Facilities provide nursing care, physical therapy, meals,
                                            recreational activities, personal services, and assistance with activities of daily living.</p>
                                        <p><b>What is Community Support Facility?</b></p>
                                        <p>Only Rest Homes with this CSF (Community Support Facility) designation can admit residents with mental health without gaining any other approval or waiver.</p>
                                        <p><b>What is life at a Rest Home like?</b></p>
                                        <p>Living in Rest Home is a combination of housing, personalized support services, health care and activities for disabled persons or seniors who seek help with the elements of daily living. River Valley Rest Home
                                            provides individualized assistance to help residents maintain their independence while living in private / shared rooms and enjoying delicious, cooked-from-scratch restaurant-style meals. Our residents also

                                            financial options with you when you contact River Valley Rest Home’s administrator.</p>

                                        <p><b>What benefits are available for veterans, their spouses or widows? </b></p>
                                        <p>The Veterans Administration (VA) Aid and Attendance Pension is a tax-free pension benefit available to qualified veterans and their surviving spouses that provides a direct monthly pension to help defray the cost
                                            of rest home care. River Valley Rest Home helps veterans and their surviving spouses in navigating the complicated process of applying for their Aid and Attendance benefits. We work with qualified agencies that
                                            understand the VA system and can guide recipients through the entire process. For more information on Veterans benefits, please contact one of our retirement counselors, and visit Veteranaid.org.</p>

                                        <p>Choosing the right senior community is not something to be taken lightly. Before making a decision, tour the facility, meet the staff and see how they operate. Consider the community’s physical appearance and be
                                            sure it is clean and has friendly residents. Look for a place that offers quality care, along with experienced management and caring staff. At River Valley Rest Home, we take pride in our track record of providing

                                        <p><b>What services do you offer for those with Alzheimer’s or memory loss?</b></p>
                                        <p>The River Valley Rest Home does not offer memory care services for residents living with Alzheimer’s and other memory-related impairments. </p>
                                        <p><b>What is respite care, and is it offered at River Valley Rest Home?</b></p>
                                        <p>No, River Valley Rest Home does not offer respite care. Respite programs allow seniors to schedule short-term stays in assisted living for a variety of reasons. Some seniors may need additional care after a hospital
                                            stay. Families may need a temporary break from the responsibilities of caring for their elderly loved ones. Respite care can also serve as a “trial run” for a longer-term transition to senior community living.
                                        </p>
                                        <p><b>What personal care services are available to residents?</b></p>
                                        <p>Our trained and professional staff is available on site 24 hours a day to provide help with all the activities of daily living. This may include assistance with bathing, medication, dressing, grooming, escorting
                                            and moving residents throughout the community.</p>
                                        <p><b>Can someone help me take my medications?</b></p>
                                        <p>Many residents choose to move into River Valley Rest Home because they can no longer manage their medications on their own. During our personalized patient assessment process, we determine whether residents are
                                            able to self-administer their medication. If not, a medication management plan will be developed.</p>
                                        <p><b>Can you prevent residents from falling?</b></p>
                                        <p>Unfortunately, not. A heightened risk of falls is an inevitable consequence of the aging process, and no retirement community, or even nursing home, can entirely prevent residents from falling. At River Valley Rest
                                            Home, however, we have taken a proactive approach and developed a Fall Awareness Program. It starts with a risk assessment for each of our residents, and analyzes their medications and any history of falls.
                                            Next, we develop an individualized fall-prevention action plan for each resident, including personal goals and strategies for achieving them. Finally, we regularly examine River Valley Rest Home for any environmental
                                            hazards that need to be eliminated or reduced.</p>
                                        <p><b>Are housekeeping and laundry services available?</b></p>
                                        <p>Our standard inclusive rates include weekly housekeeping and personal laundry services. Coin Laundry are also available off site for residents who elect to do their own laundry.
                                        </p>
                                        <p><b>What social and recreational activities do you have available?</b></p>
                                        <p>Our Personal Expressions staff provide a wide range of social, recreational, cultural, and physical activities at the River Valley Rest Home. Events are planned for varying interests and ability levels, while regular
                                            outings are scheduled for shopping, dining, visits to local attractions, and other social activities. Entertainment and education opportunities are scheduled throughout the month along with family brunches and
                                            an quarterly barbeque. Please request an activity calendar to learn more about the wide range of offerings.</p>
                                        <p><b>Are residents allowed to have pets?</b></p>
                                        <p>At River Valley Rest Home we appreciate the close connection many people have with their pets. But, pets are only allowed to visit the residents. Few residents have allergies and we cannot allow the residents to
                                            have the pets in their room for extended period of time.</p>
                                        <p><b>Where is your Rest Home located?</b></p>
                                        <p>River Valley Rest Home is located at 159 Pine Street, Florence, MA. </p>
